-   Number: being used to store numeric value, such as integer or double
-   String
-   Boolean : Represents two value - true or false
-   Lists : Collections of ordered objects (or value). The elements in the list are separated by the comma enclose in the square bracket
-   Maps : Being used to store value in key-value pairs. Each key is associated with its value.
-   Runes : The special of String Unicode UTF-32 units. It is used to present special syntax
-   Symbols: The object which are used to refer an operator or identifier that declare in a Dart program
-   Dynamic: The variable type is not specified explicitly

Control flow statements:
-   if and else
-   for loops
-   while and do-while loops
-   break and continue
-   switch and case
-   assert

Null Safety: Types in code default are non-nullable. Unless it was told nullable by adding ? to its type declaration.
Non-nullable top-level variables and static fields must have initializers.Non-nullable instance fields must be initialized
before the constructor body begins.
